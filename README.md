# Introduction 

The new developer has written bad, incomprehensible code, you have to improve the implementation of the class
`Algorithm/Finder.php`. The problem is no ones can understand what is does.

The good news: at least there are unit tests to prove the code is working. 

You job is to refactor the code to make it readable and pass all the tests. 

# Tips

Anything is fair game, create new classes, new methods, and rename tests. 
The only restriction is that the existing tests have to keep working. 
Lean on the tests and run them after every small change to make sure you are on the right path.

# Rules

* Commit regularly
* All the tests should be green 

# Deliverable

* Link of the git repository
* Commit messages
* File/message/email explaining your process and principles you've followed
