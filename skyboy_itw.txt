* Exercise 1

Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 

For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.


* Exercise 2

Given a sorted array of integer numbers, write a function which returns the position of the specified value.
The function should return -1 if the requested number is not found in the array.

Example:

arr = [4, 5, 8, 15, 21, 24, 56, 87]

valuePosition(arr, 21)
returns 4

valuePosition(arr, 22)
returns -1
